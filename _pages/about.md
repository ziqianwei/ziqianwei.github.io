I am a graduate student in Statistics at the University of Michigan**, advised by Prof. Ji Zhu. Previously, I completed my B.Sc. in Mathematics (Specialist, High Distinction) with a Minor in Computer Science at the University of Toronto, where I developed a strong foundation in topology, Riemannian geometry, and convex optimization.  

My research currently focuses on geometry-aware latent-space models for sparse and over-dispersed network data, working on the Latent Space Zero-Inflated Poisson (LS-ZIP) framework—a model that captures structural sparsity while preserving geometric interpretability.  

Broadly, I am motivated by questions that connect structure, geometry, and uncertainty—building models that are not only predictive but also interpretable in a mathematically principled way.
