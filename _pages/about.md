I am a graduate student in Statistics at the University of Michigan, advised by **Prof. Ji Zhu**.  
My research focuses on *geometry-aware latent space models* for sparse and over-dispersed networks, with a particular interest in **latent-space zero-inflated Poisson (LS-ZIP) models**, **intrinsic dimension estimation**, and **theoretical identifiability under geometric constraints**.

My current projects aim to bridge probabilistic modeling and geometric representation, developing scalable inference algorithms and information-theoretic criteria for understanding high-dimensional relational data.

Previously, I completed my B.Sc. in Mathematics (Specialist, High Distinction) with a Minor in Computer Science at the **University of Toronto**, where I built a rigorous foundation in topology, Riemannian geometry, and convex optimization.

Beyond statistics, I am deeply interested in mathematical structure, generative modeling, and the intersection of theory and computation in modern data analysis.
