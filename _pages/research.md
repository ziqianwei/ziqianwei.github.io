### 🧮 Latent Space Zero-Inflated Poisson (LS-ZIP) Model
A unified probabilistic framework for modeling sparse, over-dispersed network data using a low-dimensional latent geometry.  
I develop efficient gradient-based and EM-style algorithms for parameter estimation, and study identifiability under sparsity and curvature constraints.  
This work bridges geometry, network statistics, and probabilistic modeling.

### 📊 Intrinsic Dimension Estimation in Latent Space Models
A theoretical investigation of how to determine the true latent dimension \(d^*\) that best captures the structure of a network.  
I explore mutual-information-based criteria, Procrustes stability, and spectral perturbation theory to quantify information loss across dimensions.

### 🧫 Single-Cell Foundation Model Benchmarking
Benchmarked foundation models (scGPT, Geneformer, scBERT, scFoundation) on tasks such as cell-type prediction, batch integration, and cross-modality transfer.  
I contributed the **scBERT batch integration pipeline**, including embedding generation and UMAP visualization on the **Great Lakes HPC cluster**.

### 🌍 Geometry-Aware Curvature Modeling
Earlier work at the Chinese Academy of Sciences on spatial statistics and curvature modeling, using geometric features to analyze regional variations in geophysical data.
